Music Recommendation
Will Fraisl and Erik Fox

Data Set:
	Spotify API
Project Idea (2 paragraphs):
	Our project will be a song recommendation system. It will use songs frequently listened to by the user to predict new songs that they may enjoy. This will function similarly to pandora where users input a starting artist or song and learns a user's music taste through a like and dislike system.
	With Spotify’s API we will have access to all Spotify’s music. Each song also has attributes attached to it such as popularity, danciblity, etc. We will use these attributes to find similar songs that a user may enjoy.  Connecting both the user’s likes and dislikes along with the attributes of songs, we will be able to create a system that recommends songs that the user will like.
Software needed:
	We will need to write a basic interface where users can create a station that will display song and the option to like or dislike or skip.  We will create either a local interface, or a simple website.  Also, we need to manipulate the data 
Computing resources:
	scikit learn or tensorflow, Go or python, iccsl or aws

Teammates:

Milestone:
	Our milestone is to have the interface complete and have a basic recommendation system based on a few of the attributes provided by spotify.  In this milestone, we will not yet have the user’s likes and dislikes, but just recommends songs based on other songs.
