# RNN-Music

### Project Idea:

Our project will be a song recommendation system. It will use songs frequently listened to by the user to predict new songs that they may enjoy. This will function similarly to pandora where users input a starting artist or song and learns a user's music taste through a like and dislike system.
With Spotify’s API we will have access to all Spotify’s music. Each song also has attributes attached to it such as popularity, danciblity, etc. We will use these attributes to find similar songs that a user may enjoy.  Connecting both the user’s likes and dislikes along with the attributes of songs, we will be able to create a system that recommends songs that the user will like.
